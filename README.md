# mcp443x_i2c_msg_tests
Repo for unit testing I2C driver messages for the mcp443x digital potentiometers.

In the Src folder there is a git submodule for the mcp_I2C_Msgs git Repo.
If that folder is opened and is empty then the submodule will need to also be cloned before running MAKE.
Using Git Bash enter the following commands when in the master repo:
1) git submodule init
2) git submodule update

After running those commands then the folder should be populated with the src code from the submodule.
